Added default values for the ``py_modules`` and ``packages`` options.
Setuptools will try to find the best values assuming that the package uses
either the *src-layout* (a ``src`` directory containing all the packages),
the *flat-layout* (a single directory with the same name as the distribution
as the top-level package), or the *single-module* approach (a single Python
file with the same name as the distribution).
This behavior will be observed **only if both of options are not explicitly
set**.
