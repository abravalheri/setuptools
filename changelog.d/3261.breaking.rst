Projects that were abusing ``include_package_data=True`` to automatically add
sub-packages and sub-modules will find the built wheel distribution no longer
including some files.

These projects are encouraged to properly configure ``packages`` to include all
sub-packages. More information can be found in :doc:`userguide/package_discovery`.

The previous behaviour was unintentional and caused a bug (#3260).
