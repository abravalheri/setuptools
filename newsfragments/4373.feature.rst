Started the process to improve compliance of ``egg_info.tag_date`` and
``egg_info.tag_build`` with the restrictions about dynamic versions in
the :doc:`packaging:specifications/pyproject-toml`.
The first step implemented is to issue a warning when ``tag_data/tag_info``
are used together with static versions.
In future releases after the grade period, this warning will be converted to an error.
